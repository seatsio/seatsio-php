# seatsio-php, the official Seats.io PHP client library

![Build](https://github.com/seatsio/seatsio-php/workflows/Build/badge.svg)
[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/seatsio/seatsio-php/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/seatsio/seatsio-php)

This is the official PHP client library for the [Seats.io V2 REST API](https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-overview).

## Installing seatsio-php

The recommended way to install seatsio-php is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```bash
composer require seatsio/seatsio-php
```

The minimum required PHP version is 7.1.

## Versioning

seatsio-php follows semver since v62.3.0.

## Examples

### Creating a chart and an event

```php
// pass in the region in which you created your seats.io account
// workspace secret key can be found on https://app.seats.io/workspace-settings
$seatsio = new SeatsioClient(Region::EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>);
$chart = $seatsio->charts->create();
$event = $seatsio->events->create($chart->key);
echo 'Created event with key ' . $event->key;
```

### Booking objects

Changes the object status to ‘booked’. Booked seats are not selectable on a rendered chart.

[https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-book-objects](https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-book-objects)

```php
$seatsio = new SeatsioClient(Region::EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>);
$seatsio->events->book(<AN EVENT KEY>, ["A-1", "A-2"]);
```

### Booking objects that have been held

```php
$seatsio = new SeatsioClient(Region::EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>);
$seatsio->events->book(<AN EVENT KEY>, ["A-1", "A-2"], <A HOLD TOKEN>);
```

### Booking general admission areas

Either

```php
$seatsio = new SeatsioClient(Region::EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>);
$seatsio->events->book(<AN EVENT KEY>, ["GA1", "GA1", "GA1"]);
```

Or

```php
$seatsio = new SeatsioClient(Region::EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>);
$seatsio->events->book(<AN EVENT KEY>, [["objectId" => "GA1", "quantity" => 3]]);
```

### Releasing objects

Changes the object status to ‘free’. Free seats are selectable on a rendered chart.

[https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-release-objects](https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-release-objects)

```php
$seatsio = new SeatsioClient(Region::EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>);
$seatsio->events->release(<AN EVENT KEY>, ["A-1", "A-2"]);
```

### Changing object status

Changes the object status to a custom status of your choice. If you need more statuses than just booked and free, you can use this to change the status of a seat, table or booth to your own custom status.

[https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-custom-object-status](https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-custom-object-status)

```php
$seatsio = new SeatsioClient(Region::EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>);
$seatsio->events->changeObjectStatus(<AN EVENT KEY>, ["A-1", "A-2"], "unavailable");
```

### Event reports

Want to know which seats of an event are booked, and which ones are free? That’s where reporting comes in handy.

The report types you can choose from are:
- byStatus
- byCategoryLabel
- byCategoryKey
- byLabel
- byOrderId

[https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-event-reports](https://docs.seats.io/docs/api-event-reports)

```php
$seatsio = new SeatsioClient(Region::EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>);
$seatsio->eventReports->byStatus(<AN EVENT KEY>, <OPTIONAL FILTER>);
```

### Listing all charts

```php
$seatsio = new SeatsioClient(Region::EU(), <WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>);

$charts = $seatsio->charts->listAll();
foreach($charts as $chart) {
    echo 'Chart ' . $chart->key;
}
```

Note: `listAll()` returns an iterator, which under the hood calls the seats.io API to fetch charts page by page. So multiple API calls may be done underneath to fetch all charts.

### Listing charts page by page

E.g. to show charts in a paginated list on a dashboard.

Each page contains an `items` array of charts, and `nextPageStartsAfter` and `previousPageEndsBefore` properties. Those properties are the chart IDs after which the next page starts or the previous page ends.

```php
// ... user initially opens the screen ...

$firstPage = $seatsio->charts->listFirstPage();
foreach($firstPage->items as $chart) {
    echo 'Chart ' . $chart->key;
}
```

```php
// ... user clicks on 'next page' button ...

$nextPage = $seatsio->charts->listPageAfter($firstPage->nextPageStartsAfter);
foreach($nextPage->items as $chart) {
    echo 'Chart ' . $chart->key;
}
```

```php
// ... user clicks on 'previous page' button ...

$previousPage = $seatsio->charts->listPageBefore($nextPage->previousPageEndsBefore);
foreach($page->items as $chart) {
    echo 'Chart ' . $chart->key;
}
```

### Creating a workspace

```php
$seatsio = new SeatsioClient(Region::EU(), <COMPANY ADMIN KEY>);
$seatsio->workspaces->create("a workspace");
```

## Error handling

When an API call results in a 4xx or 5xx error (e.g. when a chart could not be found), a SeatsioException is thrown.

This exception contains a message string describing what went wrong, and also two other properties:

- `messages`: an array of error messages that the server returned. In most cases, this array will contain only one element.
- `requestId`: the identifier of the request you made. Please mention this to us when you have questions, as it will make debugging easier.

## Rate limiting - exponential backoff

This library supports [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff).

When you send too many concurrent requests, the server returns an error `429 - Too Many Requests`. We react to this by waiting for a while, and then retrying the request.
If the request still fails with an error `429`, we wait a little longer, and try again. This happens at most 5 times, before we give up (after approximately 15 seconds).

## Upgrading

### v72 -> v73

The `SeatsioClient` now takes a region as first parameter. This is the region of your account.

### v69 -> v70

Switched to builder pattern for creating social distancing rulesets. Removed constructor of `SocialDistancingRuleset` class.

Rule-based rulesets:

```php
$ruleset = SocialDistancingRuleset::ruleBased("My first ruleset")
    ->setIndex(0)
    ->setNumberOfDisabledSeatsToTheSides(1)
    ->setDisableSeatsInFrontAndBehind(true)
    ->setDisableDiagonalSeatsInFrontAndBehind(true)
    ->setNumberOfDisabledAisleSeats(2)
    ->setMaxGroupSize(1)
    ->setMaxOccupancyAbsolute(10)
    ->setOneGroupPerTable(true)
    ->setDisabledSeats(["A-1"])
    ->setEnabledSeats(["A-2"])
    ->build();
```

Fixed rulesets:

```php
$ruleset = SocialDistancingRuleset::fixed("My second ruleset")
    ->setIndex(1)
    ->setDisabledSeats(["A-1"])
    ->build();
```

### v68 -> v69

Replaced `SeatsioException->$messages` by `SeatsioException->$errors`. An error contains both a `$code` and a `$message`.

To implement logic based on the exception type, use the techincal `$code` instead of the human-readable `$message`.

### v67 -> v68

#### Retrieving an event

The `Event` class does not have `$bookWholeTables` and `$tableBookingModes` properties anymore. Those are replaced by a single
`$tableBookingConfig` property:

- `$bookWholeTables` equal to `true` corresponds to a `$tableBookingConfig` with `$mode` equal to `ALL_BY_TABLE`
- `$bookWholeTables` equal to `false` corresponds to a `$tableBookingConfig` with `$mode` either `ALL_BY_SEAT`, `INHERIT` or `CUSTOM`
- The list of tables in `$tableBookingModes` is now `$tableBookingConfig->tables` (but only if `$mode` equals `CUSTOM`)

#### Creating an event

When creating an event, you now pass in an (optional) `$tableBookingConfig` instead of `$bookWholeTablesOrTableBookingModes`:

```php
$seatsioClient->events->create(
  "4250fffc-e41f-c7cb-986a-2c5e728b8c28", null,
  TableBookingConfig::custom(["T1" => "BY_TABLE", "T2" => "BY_SEAT"])
);
```

#### Creating multiple events

When creating multiple events, you now pass in an (optional) `$tableBookingConfig` instead of `$bookWholeTables` and `$tableBookingModes`:

```php
$params = [
    (new EventCreationParams())
    ->setEventKey("event34")
    ->setTableBookingConfig(TableBookingConfig::allByTable()),
    (new EventCreationParams())
    ->setEventKey("event35")
    ->setTableBookingConfig(TableBookingConfig::allBySeat())
];

$events = $seatsioClient->events->createMultiple("4250fffc-e41f-c7cb-986a-2c5e728b8c28", $params);
```

### v66 -> v67

No migration needed

### v65 -> v66

You now need to be on PHP 7.1 or newer to use this library.

### v64 -> v65

Added boolean parameter `$oneGroupPerTable` to the constructor of `SocialDistancingRuleset`. Pass in `false` to not force only one group
to sit at a table.

Also added this parameter to `SocialDistancingRuleset::ruleBased()`

### v63 -> v64

Added `$maxOccupancyAbsolute`, `$maxOccupancyPercentage` and `$fixedGroupLayout` to the constructor of `SocialDistancingRuleset`.

To keep the default behaviour, pass in the following:

- `$maxOccupancyAbsolute = 0`
- `$maxOccupancyPercentage = 0`
- `$fixedGroupLayout = false`

### v62 -> v63

`events->bookBestAvailable()`, `events->holdBestAvailable()` and `events->changeBestAvailableObjectStatus()` take optional `$extraData` and
`$ticketTypes` parameters. Pass in `null` to keep the default behaviour.
